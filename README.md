## About Me
Hi! My name is Aditya. I am a graduate English literature student from the State Islamic University of Syahid Jakarta. I recently discovered a new passion that involves working with Linux. I then began to educate myself on programming languages. My latest foray into programming is documented on my repository account.

As a passionate Linux user, I embrace the power of ArcoLinux, utilizing its user-friendly features and flexibility. Vim has become my preferred text editor, revolutionizing the way I work with code and text. To enhance my workflow, I've adopted dwm from the suckless software community as my window manager, embodying simplicity and efficiency.
